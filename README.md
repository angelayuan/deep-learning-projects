# deep-learning-projects
There is where I save my scripts of DL projects (learn from https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
Aim to apply these knowledge and skills to projects of neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., establishing CNN on large-scale neuroimaging dataset to predict clinical results)

## 1. Learn from coursera 
### neural networks and deep learning 


### Improving deep neural networks: hyperparameter tuning, regularization and optimization

### Structuring your machine learning project

### Convolutional neural networks

### Natural language processing: building sequence models (RNN, LSTM)

## 2. Autism classification


## 3. PNC age prediction
